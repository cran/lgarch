Version 0.7 (25 March 2025)
===========================


* class checking in rss() is now done with is()

* minor changes to DESCRIPTION file

* minor changes to virtually all the .Rd files (i.e. the help-files)

* fix:
- mlgarch(): bug-fix (thanks to Rik Wienke!) that affected the dimension of the 'xreg' argument


Version 0.6-2 (14 September 2015)
=================================

* lgarch():
- formula for the variance-covariance matrix of the ARMA-representation corrected when method = "ls"
- improved column-names handling of X-regressors
- the dates/index of regressor(s), i.e. the xreg argument, is automatically matched with dates/index of the regressand


Version 0.5 (1 September 2014)
==============================

* lgarchSim: c.code argument added with default TRUE (i.e. compiled C-code is used for the recursion; this speeds up simulations considerably)

* S3 method summary() added for objects of class lgarch and mlgarch

* lgarch() and mlgarch() functions: backcast.values argument removed

* lgarchRecursion1(): for improved numerical stability, the backcast values of ln(y^2) was changed to the empirical mean. Also, a bug that occurred whenever c.code = FALSE was corrected


Version 0.4 (1 July 2014)
=========================

* lgarch():
- mean-correction as estimation-option added
- a third estimation method was added: QML via the centred Chi-squared distribution as instrumental density
- fitted.lgarch(): bug fix (the bug induced incorrect fitted values at zero-locations)
- stylistic changes to the documentation


Version 0.3 (1 June 2014)
=========================

* functions and S3 methods for the simulation and estimation of the multivariate CCC-log-GARCH(1,1) model were added

* gdiff() function added

* rss.lgarch() function changed name to rss

* zoo-related bug corrected in glag()

* glag() function: improved further, and the pad argument in the glag function acquired a new default (TRUE)

* minor improvements throughout, and several stylistic changes made to the documentation


Version 0.2 (28 April 2014)
===========================

* lgarch():
- a couple of bugs corrected in the parameter-indexing, which ocurred whenever the garch order argument was set to 0
- argument logl.penalty changed name to objective.penalty
- the argument method=c("ml","ls") was added. If method="ml", then estimation is with Gaussian QML via the ARMA representation. If method="ls", then estimation is with least squares via the ARMA representation. Although asymptotically equivalent in most respects, the latter is slightly faster since one parameter less is estimated

* glag(): Completely rewritten. Now it can also lag matrices, and it gives a "special treatment" to zoo-objects (the indexing is retained)

* lgarchLogl() function changed name to lgarchObjective()

* new functions:
- rss.lgarch(), extract the Residual Sum of Squares of the ARMA representation an object of class lgarch
- mlgarchSim(), simulate from a multivariate log-GARCH(1,1)
- rmnorm(), simulate from multivariate normal distribution


Version 0.1 (18 March 2014)
===========================

* all versions until 1.0 should be considered as beta-versions
